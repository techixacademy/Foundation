1. Starting and Syncing
Before you write a single line of code, you need to make sure your local environment matches the "source of truth" (usually on GitHub or GitLab).

git clone [URL]: Downloads a project from a remote server to your computer.

git pull: Fetches the latest changes from the remote server and merges them into your current branch. Do this often to avoid messy conflicts later.

2. The Inner Loop (The "Save" Process)
This is the bread and butter of your workday. It’s a three-step process: Stage → Commit → Push.

git status: Your best friend. It tells you which files you've changed and what is currently "staged" for a commit.

git add [file-name]: Moves changes from your working directory to the Staging Area. Use git add . to stage everything at once.

git commit -m "Your message": Takes a snapshot of your staged changes. Keep your messages descriptive (e.g., "Fix login button alignment").

git push: Sends your local commits to the remote server so your teammates can see them.

3. Branching and Switching
In a professional setting, you almost never work directly on the "main" or "master" branch. You create "feature branches."

git branch: Lists all branches in your repository.

git checkout -b [branch-name]: Creates a new branch and switches you to it immediately.

git checkout [branch-name]: Switches back to an existing branch.

4. Undoing Mistakes
We all have those "oops" moments. Git is very forgiving if you know the right commands.

Command	What it does
git restore [file]	Discards local changes in a file and reverts it to the last committed state.
git commit --amend	Adds forgotten changes to your last commit (great for fixing typos).
git log	Shows a history of all commits so you can find a point to return to.
